This Python script is designed to identify instances of `postMessage` in JavaScript files fetched from a specified URL. It extracts the arguments passed to `postMessage` and provides context around each instance to help with security analysis.

## Features

- Fetches JavaScript content from a user-specified URL.
- Identifies instances of `postMessage` and extracts their arguments.
- Provides context around each `postMessage` instance for better understanding.
- Handles HTTP errors gracefully.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**


**Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```sh
    pip install requests
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the script:**

    ```sh
    python postmessage_recon.py
    ```

2. **Enter the target URL when prompted:**

    ```sh
    Enter the target URL (e.g., https://example.com/script.js): 
    ```

3. **Review the results:**

    The script will display any `postMessage` instances found along with the arguments passed and the surrounding context.
